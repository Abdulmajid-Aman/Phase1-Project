I want to make a sign up website. This website existing users can log back in and view their account details

The user details include : {
    name : 'User name',
    email : 'user@email.com',
    followers: number,
    data_of_sign_in: number,
    profile_pic: picture
}

// FOR A NEW USER 
1. The user will need to sign up using an email
2. The user will need to create a password
3. The user will need to create a username
4. The user will need to upload a profile picture

// All this should be done using a text input field so that we can submit the new user
// Here we will send a post request with a specific endpoint i.e {/users}
// The user should be notified that the account has been created 


// FOR AN EXISTING USER
1. The user will need to log in using their email and password
2. The user will need to be redirected to their account page
3. The account page should contain the user detail listed above


// BONUS FEATURE
1. User can edit his account information
2. Create an admin account where you can view all the users signed up to your website

// THE ADMIN 
1. Once he logs in, all the users are displayed on the left side of his page.
2. He can click on a user and view his account details
3. He can also delete a user
